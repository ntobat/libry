The short chapters are deceptive - take your time to savour this feast for the brain and the senses.",

Both have led incredibly dreadful lives - one because of her religious beliefs, the other because of an abusive husband compounded by extreme poverty. Their experiences give Steponas the inspiration to write about his own terrible secret, one that he has kept hidden in the chambers of his heart for many years.  You need to stay awake and on track with this novel. It begins slowly but persevere and don't have any illusion that  the story will 'lighten' as it progresses. It doesn't.  The setting of Lithuania and the ghettos of Poland make for a sad read but you may enjoy this if you have a passing interest in the history of the war and its effect on those who lived through it.",

Instead, at 80, she's dodging bailiffs with help from her politically radical grandson, and at the same time relying on her daughter's government connections for comforts such as coffee and rice.  Frances's dead-pan memoirs bring a delicious sense of the absurd to this economically bleak alternative universe.",

The narrative of a failing marriage and a passionate physical bond makes the 29 short sections immediately accessible but, at the same time, frustratingly elusive.  She uses the word 'tangos' to describe each of the sections which evokes the image of a couple locked in a complex dance, but may also refer to the mix of fluid and staccato rhythms of the words on the page.  She prefaces 'tango' with a small, enigmatic quote from Keats to whom she dedicates the book.  The echo of his sentiment -  Beauty is truth and truth beauty - seems to underpin the Beauty of the Husband both literally and metaphorically, though on two readings this reader would be hard pressed to say how!",

These young men are testing themselves against their fathers and against their environments in stories that can be quite disturbing.",

It tells how she survived the horrors of the Second World War.  Her life is a series of struggles and disappointments, but she never gives up in her search for happiness.The second tells of a young woman's stay in London while researching a book.  A disturbing neighbour's life story has an unsettling effect on the main character.  Watch out for the twist in the tale - it makes for an enthralling read.",

A ghost story with a difference, this is a philosophical exploration of childhood innocence and the delicate balance between being different and the desire to belong to the group. Its uncanniness is creepy, but it's gentle not graphic. Interweaving the voices of the group of girls with the desperate solo voice of Marina is a captivating way of telling this haunting story.",

   "descr": "The ultimate quest – a search for love. This playful but clever short novel reminds me somewhat of bubble and squeak - parallel plots, dialogue, imagery and characters all cooked together to make a tasty meal. Although technically an easy read, concentration is a must to get your head around the characters (think Dickens at his most descriptive) and how they fit together.  The ending is a treat and completely unexpected for all concerned.",

Issues raised cover customs, family life, male jealousy, snobbery and poverty.  Indeed they don't shy away from these controversial subjects.

   "descr": "Sarah is torn between her past in war-ravaged Beirut and the freedom she enjoys in New York; but she always yearns for where she has left. Neither can she sustain a successful relationship, whether with husband, lover, parents or son.  She seeks resolution by writing her memoir, but can't get beyond chapter one. The resulting book is comprised entirely of first chapters as she seeks ways into her past. These shifting perspectives and fresh starts give the book a surprising pace to go with its originality; and while sometimes confusing it flows well and all comes together in the end.  A touching and quietly humorous tale.",

This semi-fictional narrative relates the final days of a corrupt, decaying society, where racketeering and trafficking flourish, and playing the system is necessary for survival. Under constant surveillance, everyone has hidden motives and no-one is to be trusted - a fine recipe for gripping, chilling suspense.",

The feel of the period is captured beautifully, and although the story focusses on Piet Barol, a young tutor in a rich family, you feel at the end that you know, and like, a large number of characters very well.  It has the feel of a very erotic soap opera and it's tantalisingly readable!",

And this is made worse by being an Arab in Jerusalem, where his self-respect is undermined on a daily basis, where family honour is at the heart of all personal relationships. A blazing row and reconciliation will not suffice. A compelling insight into the life of an occupied people.",

Or discovering that your father knew that she was lying and that there were consequences that you were not really aware of when you were growing up. And you find out because a Colombian comes visiting Northern Ireland.  An easy read and a good introduction to the complexities of the struggle.",

The pieces vary in length and are mixed in style, with some vibrant and beautiful and others dark and disturbing.  The whole provides a wonderful introduction to a diverse group of authors and I found myself jotting down names to look up and read again in the future.",

An 'innocent' hate crime by Zach draws his mother and her siblings together into a series of fraught meetings and telephone calls.  Whilst the story for me lacks some 'bite', it does raise the interesting way in which, over the months, the family dynamic changes.  The saying you can choose your friends and not your family rings true.",
